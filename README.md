<h1>Using Backbone as Embedded JavaScript for the Mobile SDK</h1>
This project shows using the Javascript MVC framework Backbone with the Cordova plugins 
provided with the Salesforce Mobile SDK.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
First, you'll need the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Mobile_SDK">Mobile SDK</a> itself.  Follow the download and install instructions for the project of your choice (iOS or Android).

Once you have the SDK installed, start with a Hybrid Project.  Clone or download this project, and replace the *www* with the contents.  This project will replace the default HTML5 application and you'll be able to compile the project.
